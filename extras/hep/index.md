title: An HEP-inspired development exercise
---

We will use PyROOT (a Python interface to ROOT) to develop a simple program, while
introducing some concepts and techniques for testing and debugging software. This
lesson draws from

* [an earlier SWC lesson on testing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps/tree/master/python/testing)
* [this testing "cheat sheet"](https://github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps/blob/master/python/testing/cheat-sheet.md)

We will also use a ROOT data file

* [events.root](../../data/hep/events.root)
